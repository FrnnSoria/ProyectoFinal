# ProyectoFinal
Final Proyect for the subjectof Object Oriented Programming (DIEF, UNIMORE)
Description:
Application written in Java, which consists of viewing images from a folder selected by the user, in Java language.

Interface:
Panel where the image is displayed
Buttons to switch to next image, previous image, slide mode and send images by e-mail using sockets
The image, at the moment of being displayed on the screen, must be resized to the size of the panel
It must also be resized when entering the presentation mode, which is probably using fullscreen, if we have time and/or desire to do so.

Multitasking features will be used in...
Slider, to be able to zoom the image, add scrollbars in the panel, to be able to navigate within the image/panel.
Progress bar for the moment of uploading and sending the images to a random e-mail, check that they have been received from that e-mail.

Flow:
After starting, you must select the folder from which you are going to read the images in .jpeg .png .gif .bmp format
Then all other 'functions' will be accessible
